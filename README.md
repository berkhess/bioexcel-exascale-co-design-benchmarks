# bioexcel-exascale-co-design-benchmarks

Exascale co-design benchmarks and kernels produced by BioExcel, an EC
HPC Centre of Excellence.

The contents relates to the BioExcel core applications: GROMACS,
HADDOCK, and CP2K. It is intended to provide a simple way for people
not expert in those software packages to obtain relevant feedback.
Such feedback could be relevant for considering changes to hardware,
drivers, libraries, compilers, or system configurations would be for
users of these applications.

These are

* a version of GROMACS containing a benchmark tool of ... TODO KTH
* a GROMACS N-body kernel microbenchmark ... TODO KTH
* a script to illustrate HADDOCK I/O using a benchmark containing 1M structures
* a CP2K QM/MM kernel benchmark (code + input data)
* a set of CP2K whole-application inputs on which the kernel benchmark was based

Further details are found in the respective subfolders.

and are best directed to the maintainers named in the respective
