# Contents

Two related benchmarks are contained in respective independent subdirectories. Please see the respective subdirectories for more details. 

## whole-application-benchmark
Containing:
* a CP2K input file and other inputs that taken together constitute a whole-application biomolecular QM/MM benchmark.
* guidance on how to run the whole-application benchmark, including requirements and expected runtimes.
* example CP2K output logs generated by running the whole-application benchmark on varying numbers of cores.

## kernel-benchmark
Containing: 
* a QM/MM kernel benchmark consisting of code isolated and extracted from the CP2K codebase that was found to be performance-critical running the above QM/MM whole-application benchmark.
* input data files containing values of parameters and data structures generated intermediately during execution of the whole-application benchmark and required to run the kernel.
* a minimal amount of wrapper code that reads the input data files, initialises input parameters and data structures, and calls the kernel code.
* other code from the CP2K codebase (e.g. Fortran type specifications) required to compile the kernel code.
* guidance on how to build and run the kernel benchmark.
* reference output of the kernel benchmark.
