Determining Verlet buffer for a tolerance of 0.005 kJ/mol/ps at 300 K
Calculated rlist for 1x1 atom pair-list as 0.917 nm, buffer size 0.017 nm
Set rlist, assuming 4x4 atom pair-list, to 0.903 nm, buffer size 0.003 nm
Note that mdrun will redetermine rlist based on the actual pair-list setup
Calculating fourier grid dimensions for X Y Z
Using a fourier grid of 32x32x32, spacing 0.094 0.094 0.094
This run will generate roughly 1 Mb of data
