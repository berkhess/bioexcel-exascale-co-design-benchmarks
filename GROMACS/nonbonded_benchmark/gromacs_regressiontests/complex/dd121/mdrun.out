GROMACS:      gmx mdrun, version 2020
Executable:   /home/mabraham/git/bioexcel-exascale-co-design-benchmarks/GROMACS/nonbonded_benchmark/gromacs_source_code/bin/gmx
Data prefix:  /home/mabraham/git/bioexcel-exascale-co-design-benchmarks/GROMACS/nonbonded_benchmark/gromacs_source_code (source tree)
Working dir:  /home/mabraham/git/bioexcel-exascale-co-design-benchmarks/GROMACS/nonbonded_benchmark/gromacs_regressiontests/complex/dd121
Command line:
  gmx mdrun -ntmpi 12 -notunepme

Reading file topol.tpr, VERSION 2020 (single precision)
Can not increase nstlist because verlet-buffer-tolerance is not set or used
Using 12 MPI threads
Using 1 OpenMP thread per tMPI thread


WARNING: Oversubscribing the available 4 logical CPU cores with 12 thread-MPI threads.
         This will cause considerable performance loss.

NOTE: Oversubscribing the CPU, will not pin threads
starting mdrun 'Protein'
20 steps,      0.1 ps.

Writing final coordinates.


Dynamic load balancing report:
 DLB was off during the run due to low measured imbalance.
 Average load imbalance: 14.0%.
 The balanceable part of the MD step is 8%, load imbalance is computed from this.
 Part of the total run time spent waiting due to load imbalance: 1.2%.


NOTE: 13 % of the run time was spent in domain decomposition,
      0 % of the run time was spent in pair search,
      you might want to increase nstlist (this has no effect on accuracy)
