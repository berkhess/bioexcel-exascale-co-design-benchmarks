Determining Verlet buffer for a tolerance of 0.005 kJ/mol/ps at 298 K
Calculated rlist for 1x1 atom pair-list as 0.905 nm, buffer size 0.005 nm
Set rlist, assuming 4x4 atom pair-list, to 0.900 nm, buffer size 0.000 nm
Note that mdrun will redetermine rlist based on the actual pair-list setup
Using a fourier grid of 56x28x28, spacing 0.108 0.108 0.108
This run will generate roughly 0 Mb of data
