Determining Verlet buffer for a tolerance of 0.005 kJ/mol/ps at 300 K
Calculated rlist for 1x1 atom pair-list as 0.910 nm, buffer size 0.010 nm
Set rlist, assuming 4x4 atom pair-list, to 0.900 nm, buffer size 0.000 nm
Note that mdrun will redetermine rlist based on the actual pair-list setup
Calculating fourier grid dimensions for X Y Z
Using a fourier grid of 16x16x16, spacing 0.117 0.117 0.117
