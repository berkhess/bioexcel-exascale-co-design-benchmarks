# Contents

Two different benchmark cases are contained in respective independent
subdirectories. Please see the respective subdirectories for more
details

## nonbonded_benchmark

nonbonded_benchmark provides a tool for observing the performance of
production versions of key GROMACS kernels on real CPU hardware.

## kernel_microbenchmark

kernel_microbenchmark provides a much simpler set of code that runs a
single version of one such kernel. It does so in a form suitable for
running a single iteration in a CPU processor simulator without the
prohibitive cost of running the full application in the simulator.
